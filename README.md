# React Coffee Order App (Work in Progress)

## Project Goal
This project is an ongoing effort to build a simple, interactive **Coffee Menu Card** interface using React. It is a learning project focused on mastering fundamental React concepts, including:
* **Component Structure**
* **Managing State (`useState`)** for interactive elements (like order quantities).
* Basic **CSS Styling** and **Flexbox** layout.

## 🏗️ Current Status
This repository currently contains the **initial structure and state logic** for the menu card component.

* The main app layout and basic styling are defined.
* The `CafeDetailCard` component successfully uses React State to **track and increment item quantities**.
